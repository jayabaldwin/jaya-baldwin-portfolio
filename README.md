## Description
For this project the Bootcamp students were required to build a portfolio to display future web applications we build, to illustrate and skills and talents to potential employers. This website must be built without starter code and will showcase what we have learned during our first 2 weeks of bootcamp. 

It is critical that we include our name, photo, description, examples of our work and directions on how to contact us. The links must scroll to their corresponding sections and the web application requires a resposive layout that adapts to any viewport.

This portfolio is designed to be continually updated over the duration of this course (and beyond). Growing and improving in fuctionality, responsivity, design and over all flair, reflecting my developing skillset.

## User Story
`GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport`
